## How it works?

The NodeJS Express API server is very simple and is defined in the file [src/unprotected-server/hello-server-unprotected.js](/servers/hello/src/unprotected-server/hello-server-unprotected.js).

The server only replies to the endpoint `/` with the message:

```json
{"message": "Hello, World!"}
```
